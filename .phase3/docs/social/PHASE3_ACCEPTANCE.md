# Phase 3 acceptance

Implemented and locally testable: durable hash-only OAuth state with atomic single-use consumption, OAuth exchange/refresh, mode-0600 token storage, profile normalization, message scheduling/cancellation/status lookup, media initialization, normalized errors/rate limits, unknown-result fail-closed behavior, deterministic new-operation canary routing, historical ownership, and rollback rules.

Blocked: real OAuth, token refresh, health, account discovery, media transfer, schedule/cancel, polling reconciliation, and provider canary. Phase 2 Postly auth is not certified and no Hootsuite developer credential or staging-safe account exists. Phase 3 must remain partial and disabled.
